# PushButtons
This simple Arduino project demonstrates how to control three LEDs using three pushbuttons. Each pushbutton is assigned to one LED, allowing the user to turn on or off a specific LED by pressing the corresponding button.

Components Used:
Arduino Uno

3 x LEDs 

3 x Pushbuttons

3 x 220Ω Resistors (for LEDs)

3 x 10kΩ Resistors (for pull-down on pushbuttons)

Breadboard

Jumper wires

How it Works:
Each pushbutton is connected to a digital input pin on the Arduino.

Each LED is connected to a digital output pin.

When a pushbutton is pressed, the Arduino detects the HIGH signal and turns ON the corresponding LED.

When the button is released, the LED turns OFF.

Features:
Demonstrates digital input/output in Arduino

Simple logic, easy to understand

Great beginner project to learn buttons
